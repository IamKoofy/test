Signing in to AAP after Switching from LDAP to Okta Integration
This guide outlines the steps for logging in to AAP after the platform transitioned from using LDAP to Okta for user authentication.

Prerequisites:

An active account in Okta, your organization's identity provider.
Knowledge of your Okta username and password (same credentials used for other Okta-integrated applications).
Steps:

Open your web browser.

Navigate to the AAP login page. (Replace <AAP_login_URL> with the actual login URL for your AAP platform).

Example: <AAP_login_URL>
You will be redirected to the Okta login page. This signifies the use of Okta for authentication.

Enter your Okta username in the designated field.

Enter your Okta password in the designated field.

Click "Sign In" or press Enter on your keyboard.

Okta may perform additional verification steps depending on your organization's security settings. These might include multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the verification process.

Upon successful authentication, you will be automatically redirected back to AAP. You should now be logged in to the platform with your assigned permissions.

Additional Notes:

If you encounter any difficulties logging in, contact your AAP administrator for assistance.
You should continue using the same username and password you use for other Okta-integrated applications within your organization.
If you haven't already, familiarize yourself with Okta's single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. SSO allows you to seamlessly access multiple applications using your Okta credentials without logging in repeatedly.
Benefits of Switching to Okta:

Centralized User Management: Okta simplifies user management by providing a single point of access for all your organization's applications.
Enhanced Security: Okta offers robust security features like multi-factor authentication to protect your account.
Improved User Experience: Okta streamlines the login process with SSO, eliminating the need to manage multiple login credentials.
We hope this guide assists you with a smooth transition to Okta-based authentication for AAP. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your AAP administrator.
